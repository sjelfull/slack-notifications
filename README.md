## Installation

To install Slack Notifications, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `slacknotifications` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/sjelfull/slacknotifications.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require sjelfull/slacknotifications`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `slacknotifications` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Slack Notifications works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.
